Over the four days the participants will work together to produce and improve the educational materials for the open-source creative coding tool openFrameworks. This will improve the approachability of openFrameworks as well as help students around the world learn how to create with this powerful digital arts and design tool. \r\n\r\n### Participants\r\n* [Golan Levin](http://flong.com/)\r\n* Anika Wilcox\r\n* [Nicole Messier](http://www.nicoleyimessier.com/)\r\n* [Stacey Mulcahy](http://thebitchwhocodes.com/)\r\n* [Sarah Howorka](http://www.sarahhoworka.com/)\r\n* [Christopher Baker](http://christopherbaker.net/)\r\n* [Deborah Schmidt](http://frauzufall.de/)\r\n* [Charlotte Stiles](http://charlottestiles.com/)\r\n* [David Newbury](http://www.workergnome.com/)\r\n* [Caroline Record](http://carolinerecord.com/)\r\n* [Dan Wilcox](http://www.danomatika.com/)\r\n* [Jeff Gray](http://grayfuse.com/)\r\n* [Andrew Hieronymi](http://ahieronymi.net/)\r\n* [Caitlin Morris](http://www.caitlinmorris.net/)\r\n* [Sarah Groff-Palermo](http://www.sarahgp.com/)\r\n* [Zach Lieberman](http://thesystemis.com/)\r\n* [Brannon Dorsey](http://brannondorsey.com/)\r\n* [Chris Coleman](http://digitalcoleman.com/)\r\n\r\n### Support Provided By\r\nSupport Provided By:  [The Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences Division @ DU](http://www.du.edu/ahss/), [Emergent Digital Practices @ DU](http://www.du.edu/ahss/edp/), The Marsico Visiting Scholars Fund, [The Frank-Ratchye STUDIO for Creative Inquiry at Carnegie Mellon University](http://studioforcreativeinquiry.org/), [The School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Art and Technology Studies Department](http://www.saic.edu/academics/departments/ats/), [The School for Poetic Computation](http://sfpc.io/)\r\n\r\n# Getting Involved!!\r\nGreetings openFrameworks Community!\r\n\r\nThis week February 18 - 21st 2016, a diverse collection of openFrameworks educators will be gathering at the Emergent Digital Practices Program in Denver, Colorado. Our _goal_ is to _make openFrameworks easier to teach and easier to learn._ Our _objectives_ are to:\r\n\r\n* **Review every example in the OF core, adding clear explanations of what each example demonstrates, how to interact with it and, as needed, what individual lines or blocks of code are doing. Update any older syntax, as required.**\r\n* **Publish OFBook.**\r\n* **Add in-line documentation to all stable public classes and functions.**\r\n\r\nGenerous community members, we invite your remote participation during the event!  There will be opportunities for community members working at all technical levels.  To facilitate remote participation we will document our meetings, coordinate todo lists, and progress [here](https://hackpad.com/2016-openFrameworks-Education-Summit-cPRTemR6phO).\r\n\r\n**To kick off the event, we will [Periscope](https://hackpad.com/2016-openFrameworks-Education-Summit-cPRTemR6phO) the initial event meeting at [9am MST](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=9am+MST+to+local+time) on February 18th.  We will also maintain a presence on the openFrameworks [IRC](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=openframeworks) and [Slack](https://openframeworks.slack.com/) channels.
