In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Support Provided By\r\nSupport Provided By:  The Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences Division @ DU, Emergent Digital Practices @ DU, The Marsico Visiting Scholars Fund, The Frank-Ratchye STUDIO for Creative Inquiry at Carnegie Mellon University, The School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Art and Technology Studies Department, The School for Poetic Computation\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
